# Solution Engineering North American Technology Division Interviews

***Note:*** This document is best viewed by clicking on this [github.io link](https://github.com/vgirish/fy19sehiring/blob/master/articles/solution-engineering-natd/README.md)

If you are currently interviewing and using Oracle provided Cloud accounts -please READ the updated "Guidelines for Oracle Cloud Account Usage" section below!!

## The Role
Solutions Engineering is more BREADTH than depth. You take the products that have already been built - extend them with your coding skills and integrate them with other products thereby building a “SOLUTION”. **This is primarily a technical job** with client interactions (60-70% technical, 40-30% communication/business).

For a successful solution engineer - you need the following traits
* Strong technical skills - This is primarily a technical job with client interactions (60-70% technical, 40-30% communication/business).
* Good communication skills - you don’t build solutions for yourself -you build them for customers and the REAL world!
* Desire to push yourself to understand a little of lot of things (you may touch upon Machine Learning, Analytics and at the same time core database or file parsing).  This is probably the most critical -do you have the drive and motivation to learn a lot!!
* Ability to work under tight deadlines - our projects can be 2-6-week bursts.
* Desire to collaborate and innovate to create solutions while working to become a full-stack developer.

## Interview Schedule

The face-to-face interview process is a technical interview outlined below:

## Technical Presentation and Demo - up to 45 minutes

| Interview Section | Minutes | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Overview | 3 - 5 | Brief overview of yourself, covering your capabilities and technical experience |
| Journey to Cloud Presentation | 15 | Brief overview of Oracle's cloud platform to a potential customer that is interested in making the journey to the cloud |
| Tech Deep dive - Oracle Cloud Demo   | 15 | Brief demo on Oracle Cloud Product(s) of interest using the account that has been provided by your recruiter|  
| Technical Q & A Interview | 10 | Technical Question and Answer Interview - Expect to be asked about projects where you were a MAJOR contributor |

## Overview

During this presentation, we ask that you provide a brief overview of yourself, including your technical experience and skills. It's not necessary to go into detail, as we will ask more questions during the **Technical Question and Answer Interview** section of the interview.

## Journey to Cloud: Presentation

The scenario for the presentation is one where you need to present a technical/business overview of Oracle’s cloud platform to a potential customer that is interested in making the journey to the cloud. The customer audience consists of technical and business level attendees. This customer is interested in moving to the cloud but is not sure whether it makes sense and whether Oracle is the right vendor. They are strictly on-premise today.  It is important to address both the business value and the technical value of the proposed solution.

This **presentation** should be no longer than <u>**15 minutes**</u> and can be based on the content found in the links provided below. This will leave enough time for Q&A.  A [Powerpoint deck is available at this link](FY18_Candidate_Cloud_Presentation.pptx). You do not have to use this specific presentation so feel free to customize it.  We suggest that you use your own words in presenting the slides.

Key focus areas:
- Expect the audience to ask for clarification on any content you show.
- Make sure you know the differences between DaaS, SaaS, PaaS and IaaS.
- Expect technical questions throughout the presentation.

## Touch the Cloud: Oracle Cloud Research and Demo

![Touch The Cloud](./images/Touch-the-Cloud.jpg)

**Touch the Cloud Presentation Overview**:

During this presentation, we ask that you provide a brief summary of the Oracle Cloud Products you have investigated and that you feel are of interest and relevance. You can find the information you need from Oracle's main [Cloud Home Page](https://cloud.oracle.com/) website. From this website you can investigate Oracle's two categories of Cloud Offerings: [Platform as a Service](https://cloud.oracle.com/en_US/paas) and [Infrastructure as a Service](https://cloud.oracle.com/en_US/iaas) . Note: The job for which you are applying will focus primarily on **Platform as a Service** and **Infrastructure as a Service**.  


### **  Demo Using Oracle Cloud Account**

Please use the Oracle cloud account provided by your recruiting coordinator.

**Expectation:**

We expect that you have made a sincere effort in using the cloud service(s) that you select to do the following:

- Show your capability to learn Oracle’s cloud services. This includes reading up documentation online before doing things and running into trouble!.
- Provide us with critical feedback if there were roadblocks
- Build out a simple solution/product/project leveraging one or more Oracle Cloud services.  While we would like to see a finished product (even if it is simple), we are more interested in your approach to building things out.  
- Suggest you look at data sets from Kaggle or other areas in public domain, leveraging REST APIs from popular non-Oracle cloud services (Maps, Twitter, Instagram, Dropbox, Box etc).  Ideally, we are looking for a full-stack development that shows us the capability to not only create front-end Apps, but also an understanding of how to connect to the backend systems.  
- Use any programming language of your choice while coding. Python, Java, Node.js, React.js, i.e. anything that you are comfortable with -  doesn’t matter to us.  
- It's always good practice to create a quick video of your work -just in case you run into issues.

**Guidelines for Oracle Cloud Account usage:**

- Do not use total of more than 3 OCPU'S.
- Delete what you don't use!. Stop the instance if needed and delete them.
- You only need 1 OCPU for each PaaS service. For example - 1 OCPU for DBaaS, 1 OCPU for Application Container Service etc.
- Do not use Oracle IOT Cloud service as you will easily run out of CPU counts allocated to the environment.
- If you are running into any technical issues, Please reach out to recruiting team ONLY after you search online!.
- Are you seeing an Overage issue message?. Likely you are running too many OCPUs (see the note about 3 OCPUs). Stop things that you don't need and delete those instances. If your account is suspended for overage issues then drop a note to recruiting team -we will see what we can do.
- Pay attention to service dependencies. For example:- You can't run an Analytics cloud without running a DB instance. And you need to remember what you did for setting up the DB instance (as you provide that password not us)



## Technical Question and Answer Interview

During this section of the interview we will ask technical questions based on your experience and our requirements of the Solution Engineering position. We hope to gain a better understanding of your development expertise, your understanding of development methodologies, and your experience with various programming languages and open source tools and frameworks.

## Visual Aids

- The interview room will be furnished with a whiteboard and laptop that you can use to present your **Journey to Cloud** and **Touch the Cloud** Presentations.
- Oracle Supplied Laptop: We will have a laptop and projector available for your use. The laptop will have connectivity to the internet, and you can bring a USB drive if you desire to load a presentation to the laptop.
